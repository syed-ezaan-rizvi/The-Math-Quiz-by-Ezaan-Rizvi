# The-Math-Quiz-by-Ezaan-Rizvi
My first "big" project I made using variables, strings, print, data types. inputs/outputs. and loops. 

In this project I learned how to use variables, strings, printing, recieving user inputs and outputs and I learned how to use loops to make my project endless. This is a simple math test with randomized numbers and operations that you are meant to solve. I learned how to make a test and how to create randomized qustions. I hope I can build off on this project in the future.
